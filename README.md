# ElectronJS with ReactJS HMR template

This is a simple template for developing Electron applications with React. HMR is enabled.

Currently there is no build script.

To run use either of the following commands to start snowpack `npm run dev:snowpack` or `yarn run dev:snowpack`.

Then in another terminal run either `npm run dev:electron` or `yarn dev:electron` to run electron and start your program.

You could also use something like the `cuncurrently` package to run both scripts at once.
